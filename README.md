# Reusable components

I created a reusable Card component built with React. This component is designed to display a title, image, and description that can be used in multiple places within an application with minimal or no modification. These components should be self-contained, accept props to customize their behavior and appearance, and be easy to compose with other components. Also i used some CSS to look interactive.
